# CMP7005

Overview

This project focuses on analysing air pollution in Beijing by handling real-world environmental data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building predictive models, and developing a graphical user interface (GUI) application. The application is designed to assist users in understanding pollutant trends and forecasting PM2.5 concentration levels using machine learning models.


Objectives

    To handle and preprocess air quality and meteorological data from multiple sites.

    To perform comprehensive EDA to uncover key insights.

    To build and evaluate machine learning models for PM2.5 prediction.

    To design and implement a multipage desktop GUI using Pythonâ€™s Tkinter framework.

    To demonstrate version control practices using Git and GitHub.
